# Professional Training and Development - User Experience and Design

"Organisations Achieve Greater Value through Professionally Coached Employees" - GaffCo Consulting Professional Communication Competence

A responsive website using only HTML 5 and CSS 3 to provide Training and Development and Coaching opportunities to organisations and individuals.

## User Experience and User Design - 5 Planes
This document covers the user experience and design of this website based on the 5 Planes from the Elements of User Experience by Jesse James Garrett:

1. Strategy Plane: User Needs and Business Objectives.
2. Scope Plane: Functional Specification (Tasks) and Content Requirements (Information).
3. Structure Plane: Interaction Design (Tasks) and Information Design (Information).
4. Skeleton Plane: Interface (Tasks), Navigation (Tasks/Information), and Information Design (Information).
5. Surface Plane: Visual Design.

## Strategy
Clients and collaborators see the value provided in terms of a broad range of Training and Development and Coaching opportunities, as well as giving the clients confidence in my abilities as a professional trainer and coach.

Clients can book anything from single courses to fully bespoke programmes to suit their needs and requirements.

### Is the Content Culturally Appropriate?
The website is aimed at both a corporate and personal audience, and has to satisfy the needs of both audiences. It has to appeal to both audiences without alienating one or the other.

The website uses appropriate icons, styles, colours, and clear navigation for all audiences.

### Is the Content Relevant?
This is a site aimed at corporate clients (HR, Training and Development, Managers), individuals looking for professional or personal coaching, and collaborators (Instructional Designers and Instructors).

### Can We Track and Catalogue the Content in an Intuitive Way?
The website uses intuitive navigation, structure and content to suit the audiences described above. It's easy to use and follow.

### Is the Technology Appropriate?
A website using HTML 5 and CSS 3 (in future JavaScript too) is an appropriate communications, marketing, and sales medium as is enables me to reach a broader and global clientele that I would struggle to reach without an Internet presence such as this website, extending my client base offering something specific that may not resonate as well on a platform such as Facebook or Twitter.

### Why are We So Special?
GaffCo Consulting Professional Communication Competence provides client knowledge, skills, and attitude (comfort and confidence) to perform at a higher professionally standard than previously.

This website proovides clear options, credibility (programmes and resumÃ©), and numerous ways to get-in-touch.

### Technology Considerations?
The website is built with business people and professional individuals in mind. It's easily accessible and read on anything from the smallest mobile devices to the largest laptop and desktop displays = Responsive Web Design.

It uses HTML 5 and CSS 3 only for the moment making it ideal on any web browser in use today, as it doesn't require support for additional scripting languages.

### Why Would a User Want This?
Building the website is a first step in a targeted marketing- and sales-campaign, and is a part of the overall business plan for GaffCo Consulting.

### B2B and B2C
The emotional background image of successful after struggle (running up a mountain) together with the motivational message ("Organisations Achieve Greater Value through Professionally Coached Employees") satisfies the emotional response of B2C users.

The clean and clutter-free interface, the clear, concise, and concrete course overview and details appeal to B2B users. On top of this they have ample communication avenues to further the conversation.

### Strategy Trade-Off
