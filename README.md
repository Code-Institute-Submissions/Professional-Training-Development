A responsive website using only HTML 5 and CSS 3 to provide Training and Development, and Coaching opportunities to organisations and individuals.

## Business
### External Users' Goals
Clients and collaborators see the value provided in terms of a broad range of Training and Development, and Coaching opportunities.

Clients can book anything from single courses to fully bespoke programmes to suit their needs and requirements.

### Site Owner's Goals
As the programme owner I position my value and skills, as well as provide examples of programmes that I can provide to clients.

This enables me to reach a broader and global clientele that I would struggle to reach without an Internet presence such as this website.

### Potential Features
Display a slection of courses, programmes, and coaching for organisations and individuals.

View existing and bespoke courses, programmes and coaching opportunities for organisations and individuals.

Check next course dates and available times, and find the "course centre" (currently my home).

Book courses (yet to be implemented using JavaScript and Python 3). Courses are currently booked via the footer middle links (Mobile, WhatsApp, Email, LinkedIn, YouTube).

## Processes
### UX

Use this section to provide insight into your UX process, focusing on who this website is for, what it is that they want to achieve and how your project is the best way to help them achieve these things.

In particular, as part of this section we recommend that you provide a list of User Stories, with the following general structure:
- As a user type, I want to perform an action, so that I can achieve a goal.

As a client, I want to..., so that.
Given (how things begin) When (action taken) Then outcome of action.

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory), or just hosted elsewhere online and can be in any format that is viewable inside the browser.

Balsamiq Wireframes here (simplified views, and not complete). [Wireframe Diagrams of the Website](https://github.com/NaoiseGaffney/Professional-Training-Development/blob/master/docs/User-Centric%20Front-End%20Development%20Project%201.pdf)

## Solution
### Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
#### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

#### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technology

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.

## Impact

## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.

### Acknowledgements

I received inspiration for this project from X
Static front end project: Write custom HTML5 and CSS3 code to create a website of at least 3 pages, or (if using a single scrolling page), at least 3 separate page areas.

Information Architecture: Incorporate a main navigation menu and structured layout (you might want to use Bootstrap to accomplish this).

Documentation: Write a README.md file for your project that explains what the project does and the value that it provides to its users.

Version Control: Use Git & GitHub for version control.

Attribution: Maintain clear separation between code written by you and code from external sources (e.g. libraries or tutorials). Attribute any code from external sources to its source via comments above the code and (for larger dependencies) in the README.

Deployment: Deploy the final version of your code to a hosting platform such as GitHub Pages.
